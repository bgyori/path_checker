# Path checker
This project implements a temporal logic-based language that allows specifying constraints for path finding on networks.
It also provides sequential hypothesis testing to allow determining sample size assuming there is a probability distribution over possible paths.

# Funding
The development of this project is funded under the DARPA Young Faculty Award
(ARO grant W911NF2010255).
